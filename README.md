# PrivateClass

*2020.05.21 Added equates for data types, and modified code to use them.*

A Class for getting at PRIVATE properties in Clarion Classes

Be sure to read the comments in the demo application.

This class was written in Clarion 10. If you wish to use it in Clarion 6, you need to use a Clarion 6 TUFO interface.

Place the JSPrivateClass.clw, JSPrivateClass.inc, and TUFO.inc in your Clarion\Accessory\libsrc\win folder (and refresh your ABC headers if using in Appgen)
